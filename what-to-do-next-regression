What to do next before deadline:
0, has already changed computer, need to make sure everything worked as before.

1, review knowledge base of class diagram and sequence diagram, if possible, play with Astah to generate these kind of diagrams.

3, try to use the concept, idea or even code from class diagram to use in sequence diagram.

4, design sequence diagram and do implementation.

5, try to incorporate sequence diagram code into the original code.
