Current status: class diagram finished, sequence diagram not beginning.

Just solved problem(s):  Security problem solved, graph can be generated now.

What to do next before deadline:

1, review knowledge base of class diagram and sequence diagram, if possible, play with Astah to generate these kind of diagrams.

2, code review the class diagram frequently to remove redundency and do necessary modifications.

3, try to use the concept, idea or even code from class diagram to use in sequence diagram.

4, design sequence diagram and do implementation.

5, try to incorporate sequence diagram code into the original code.

6, code review the integrated codes to do modification.

7, report can be done incrementally piece by piece.
